## Background
There are a large number of spatial datasets are being generated, but accessing them through the existing databases can be difficult to navigate.
Spatial transcriptomics data can be very informative, but also very confusing to analyze, requiring a trained bioinformatician.

## Overall goal
The goal is to develop a multi-agent large language model (LLM) system that simplifies exploration and analysis of HTAN spatial transcriptomics data only using natural language queries.
