    "Agent 1 focuses on downloading the data / feed information to train the LLM to be able to handle queries related to HTAN spatial transcriptomics data using prompt engineering. The prompts include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example queries from HTAN community notebook related to spatial tx and scRNA-seq\n",
    "* Downloading HTAN spatial datasets from Synapse database. The downloaded files will be used by Agent 2, and can also be used directly by an end-user\n",
    "* We also obtained metadata information obtained from https://humantumoratlas.org/standard/spatial_transcriptomics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the prompts have been provided, we then run some generalized queries to validate our work\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, we can envision expanding the prompts to include other data types and more example queries. We could also import the metadata of other data types including clinical etc (from https://humantumoratlas.org/standard/). The will enable us to build a robust agent that can handle a variety of different queries as accurately as possible.\n"
